<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p> Hello, my name is Beatrice, and I'm your tour guide for Chicago. My page will introduce you to some of my favorite places in Chicago, the beautiful architecture, good places to eat, and a little about me. </p>
<p> Chicago is a city many travel to. People from all over the world come to enjoy the scenery and beauty this city offers, some even returning to their hometowns. Many would say the food, architecture, homes, and scenery are different than anywhere around the world. </p>
<p> Come with me as I introduce you to my city! I hope you enjoy it! </p>
